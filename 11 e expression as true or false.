##Aim:
Write a python program to print the result of the following expression as true or false.


##Algorithm:

1. Compare if `1` is equal to `True`, store result in `a`.
2. Compare if `1` is equal to `False`, store result in `b`.
3. Add `True` (which is 1) to 3, store result in `c`.
4. Add `False` (which is 0) to 7, store result in `d`.
5. Print values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.


##Program:
```
##Name-Gopinath G
##Reg no-212223070007

a = (1 == True)

b = (1 == False)

c = True + 3

d = False + 7

print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)

```


##Output:

##Result:
Thus the python program to print the result of the following expression as true or false was executed successfully.
